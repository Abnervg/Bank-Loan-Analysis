- This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the important factors for a bank to give a loan and create a model to predict if a loan will be authorized or rejected.

## Data Source
- The data is named loans.csv and it contains all of the information that will be used

## Tools
- Excel: Data cleaning
- Python: EDA and Modeling
- Tableau: Creating reports

2. Handling missing values
3. Treatment of outliers

## Unique Value Exploration

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Does gender affect the chance of approval?
- What type of home ownership is the one with most applications?
- How does age impact the approval?
- Does a higher interest rate get more approval?
